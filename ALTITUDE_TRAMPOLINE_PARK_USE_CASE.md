# Altitude Trampoline Park Franchise: Incident Management SaaS Use Case

## Client Overview

Altitude Trampoline Park is a franchise-based entertainment business operating multiple indoor trampoline parks across the country. Each location offers a variety of trampoline-based activities, obstacle courses, and other attractions for visitors of all ages.

## Challenges

1. Managing safety incidents across multiple locations
2. Ensuring consistent incident reporting and follow-up procedures
3. Tracking and analyzing incident patterns to improve safety measures
4. Coordinating between franchise locations and corporate headquarters
5. Maintaining accurate records for insurance and legal purposes
6. Efficiently handling video evidence from security cameras

## How Our Incident Management SaaS Helps

### 1. Centralized Incident Tracking

- **Feature**: Multi-franchise support with centralized dashboard
- **Benefit**: Altitude's corporate team can oversee incidents across all locations while individual franchises manage their own cases.

Example: The corporate safety team can quickly identify if a particular type of incident (e.g., ankle injuries on a specific trampoline model) is occurring across multiple locations.

### 2. Standardized Reporting

- **Feature**: Customizable case creation forms
- **Benefit**: Ensures all necessary information is collected consistently for every incident.

Example: When a visitor reports an injury, staff can quickly fill out a standardized form capturing details like location within the park, type of activity, and witness information.

### 3. Floor Plan Integration

- **Feature**: Interactive floor plans with incident marking
- **Benefit**: Visualize where incidents are occurring within each park.

Example: By marking where each incident occurs on the park's floor plan, Altitude can identify potential "hot spots" that may need additional safety measures or staff supervision.

### 4. File and Video Management

- **Feature**: Secure storage and easy retrieval of incident-related files, including CCTV footage
- **Benefit**: Efficiently manage and access critical evidence for each case.

Example: When an incident occurs, staff can immediately upload security camera footage, linking it directly to the case file for easy review by management or legal teams.

### 5. Automated Workflows

- **Feature**: Customizable notification and escalation rules
- **Benefit**: Ensures proper procedures are followed and the right people are informed promptly.

Example: A serious injury automatically triggers notifications to the park manager, corporate safety team, and legal department, ensuring rapid response and proper handling.

### 6. Analytics and Reporting

- **Feature**: Advanced analytics dashboard and custom report generation
- **Benefit**: Identify trends and make data-driven decisions to improve safety.

Example: Altitude's safety team can generate monthly reports showing incident rates per 1000 visitors, comparing performance across locations and identifying successful safety initiatives for company-wide implementation.

### 7. Mobile Access

- **Feature**: Responsive design and mobile app support
- **Benefit**: Allow staff to report and manage incidents on-the-go.

Example: A floor supervisor can immediately log an incident using their smartphone, uploading photos and entering details while still on the trampoline floor.

### 8. User Role Management

- **Feature**: Granular permission settings
- **Benefit**: Ensure employees only have access to the information they need.

Example: Park managers have full access to their location's incidents, while corporate executives can view data across all franchises. Front-line staff can report incidents but cannot access sensitive details.

### 9. Compliance and Audit Trail

- **Feature**: Detailed logging of all actions within the system
- **Benefit**: Maintain accurate records for insurance, legal, and regulatory compliance.

Example: If a legal claim arises, Altitude can provide a complete audit trail of the incident, including initial report, follow-up actions, and any attached evidence.

### 10. Integration Capabilities

- **Feature**: API for connecting with other business systems
- **Benefit**: Streamline operations by connecting incident data with other key business processes.

Example: The incident management system can integrate with Altitude's customer management system, automatically checking if an involved party is a member and retrieving their contact information and visit history.

## Conclusion

By implementing our Incident Management SaaS, Altitude Trampoline Park Franchise can significantly improve its safety procedures, reduce risk, and enhance the overall customer experience. The system provides the tools needed to efficiently handle incidents, analyze trends, and make data-driven decisions to continually improve safety measures across all franchise locations.

This results in a safer environment for visitors, reduced liability for the company, and a more efficient incident management process for staff at all levels.
